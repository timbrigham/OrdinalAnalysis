  `ϑ₀ 0` is the least fixed point of `ω^·` on the domained multi-level ϑ-notation, and the
  supremum of the ω-tower over `0`.

  On `ThetaWNoteD` the fixed points of `omegaPow` are exactly the principal terms
  (`omegaPow_eq_self_iff`), so `ϑ₀ 0` is a fixed point by the normal form.  This file adds the
  two facts that make `ϑ₀ 0` the notation's own `ε₀`, stated against the notation's order and
  its own `omegaPow`, with no reading into `Ordinal`:

  * `isLeast_epsilonZero`: `ϑ₀ 0` is the *least* fixed point of `omegaPow`.  Every other
    principal term is `Ω_j`, `ϑ_j β` with `j > 0`, or `ϑ₀ β` with `β ≠ 0`, and each of these
    lies above `ϑ₀ 0` by a clause of the raw term order (`theta_lt_Omega_iff`,
    `theta_lt_theta_of_lt_level`, `theta_lt_theta_of_lt`).  Well-foundedness is not used.
  * `exists_lt_omegaTower_of_lt_epsilonZero`: every notation below `ϑ₀ 0` lies below
    `ω_m(0)` for some `m` (`omegaTower`, `HullCofinal.lean`), and conversely every `ω_m(0)`
    lies below `ϑ₀ 0` (`omegaTower_zero_lt_epsilonZero`).  The proof is induction on the term
    length: a notation below `ϑ₀ 0` is not principal (by leastness), so it is a Cantor sum whose
    entries lie below `ϑ₀ 0` (`lt_prin_iff`), each entry is below some stage by induction, and
    the sum lies below `ω^·` of the largest of those stages (`lt_omegaPow_iff`).
